## Algorithmic Toolbox Programming Assignment 01
Implement solutions that work much more faster than straightforward solutions for the following computational problems:
* compute a small Fibonacci number;
* compute the last digit of a large Fibonacci number;
* compute a huge Fibonacci number modulo *m*
* compute the greatest common divisor of two integers;
* compute the least common multiple of two integers.
